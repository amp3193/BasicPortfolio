                I am currently learning web development and this is my profile. I have a Bachelor's degree in
                Communications from Florida State. I wanted to get into Public Relations but never got past the
                mailroom. I was awesome at sorting mail though and cleaning the breakroom but never really got
                to help the business stand out in the media. I took a haitus to raise a family and after that time
                the public relations game had changed so since I would have to relearn a field I decided to make it
                software instead.<br>I taught myself QA. I took Udemy courses on software testing and took the ISTQB
                to be certified in software testing. I worked for almost 4 years testing software as a Quality
                Assurance Engineer. I found some interesting bugs and really enjoyed mobile and API testing. However, 
                I was bored. I found myself not really interested in QA. I didn't want to just test software anymore. 
                I want to make software, awesome software.<br>
                I live in Kennesaw, GA with my husband Andy and our three 
                children. I love sewing and have made some very cool costumes and some decent clothes. There is 
                typically an unfinished jigsaw puzzle out in my house; I just finished my second 3000 piece puzzle! 
                I love cats a lot, I am very thankful my husband stops me from becoming a crazy cat lady!
